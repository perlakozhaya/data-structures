Abstract Data Types (ADT)

Data Structures:

Linear
	Lists (ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector, Stack)
	Stacks
	Queues (Queue - FIFO, Dequeue - front and rear ends)

Priority Queue
	Array Implementation
	Heap Implementation
	
Trees
	Binary Tree
	AVL Tree
	B-Tree (2-3-4 Tree)
	Red-Black Tree

Hash Table
	Choosing a Hash Function
	Hash Collision and Resolution
	Hash Map/Associative Array

Table
	Array Based Table (backed by a 2D Array)
		Unsorted List - Linear Search
		Sorted List - Binary Search
	Tree Based Table (backed by a TreeMap)
		Search for an element
		Add an element
		Remove an element
	Hash Based Table (backed by a HashMap)
